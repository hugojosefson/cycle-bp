# Cycle.js bootstrap

This project aims to bring together all the tools for a quick start up of a project.

It is using `browserify` for module management, `babel` and `babelify` for ES6 transpilation
and `beefy` as development server.

## Usage

Get it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adicirstei/cycle-bp your/project/folder
```

Prepare it:
```bash
cd your/project/folder
npm install
```

Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

Build for deplyment:
```bash
npm run build
```

This `README` file is not intended to be a `browserify` manual. Substack [did a really good job at it](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook).


Enjoy it!
